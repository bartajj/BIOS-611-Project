# BIOS-611-Project
A repository for the semester-long project in BIOS 611. As part of this project, I will analyze data scraped from Airbnb for the year 2020. This data includes latitude and longitude of listing, listing description, listing title, listing price, etc. I aim to uncover ways to model and predict descriptions and prices in order to find out where the best deals are on Airbnb.
